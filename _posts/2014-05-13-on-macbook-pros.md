Lately, I've been observing people on the commuter train, and one particular type of person that I see are people (mostly men... I don't think I've ever seen a lady in this category in the past close to 2 months) sporting their corporate issued Macbook Pro laptops. Some of them are typing away at their code editors, others are filling in weekly reports, etc.

It's interesting how about the only people with Macbook Pros that I see look like they're using the corporate laptop. I don't see a lot of people who seem to be using their personal privately bought Macbook Pros (although, admittedly, I think I've seen a few people with Macbook Airs and other type of older white Macbooks). A few people who I know had Macbook Pros that they had bought by themselves took care of it as if the laptops were more valuable (or needed more care than, at least) a newborn baby. You know the drill: super padded bag case, another zipped case where the laptop is directly put inside, and a cloth covering the keyboard that is perfectly cut to the size of the screen that (I think) it's meant to protect.

Update (May/13): Yesterday I ordered a maxed out specs 13'' MBPr. After dedicating almost an entire week to look for the "right" laptop, I finally settled on that one.

In the past 1.5 weeks I've been using just my 2009 Intel Core 2 Solo (single core) Acer Aspire AS 1410, which, after adding 2 additional GB of RAM ($32 at Fry's, my favorite store) for a total of 4 GB, *and* upgrading to the latest Ubuntu 64 bit release, [14.04 LTS ftw!!] (it had a 1 year old 32 bit release installed) has turned out to be amazingly fast and responsive considering the hardware limitations. I'm just amazed at how much upping the RAM and using a 64 bit OS and applications helped unlock this baby's potential.

One of the reasons why I didn't want a MBP is that I felt that I was likely to be using Ubuntu as my primary OS anyway, given how good it has worked for me on this outdated hardware: I wasn't willing to pay the Apple premiun since I wasn't planning on using their OSX as my primary OS anyway. Long story short, I found the MBPr 13'' to be:

1.  Just *slightly* above my ~3 lb of weight limit.
2.  Twice as much RAM as competing PC Ultrabooks that I could get fast (some custom configurations have it but would take an additional 2 to 3 weeks to ship). Considering that neither MBPr nor PC Ultrabooks are user upgradeable.
3.  Twice as much SSD HDD storage capacity compared to PC Ultrabooks that I could get fast (same as the RAM).
4.  1 GHZ faster clock speed on average compared to the Ultrabooks that I was considering (2.8 GHz vs ~1.8 GHz on the Ultrabooks).
5.  Better Intel integrated video (Intel Iris 5000 series video vs Intel 4400 series video on most Ultrabooks, except for the Asus Zenbook which is only $300 chea... less expensive, but comes with half the SSD capacity, half the RAM).
6.  Better by almost 4 hours extra battery life on light usage (with not much video streaming): ~9 hrs vs ~5 hrs for most Ultrabooks.
7.  Easily run OSX, which I was planning to do either using VMs or remote desktop connecting to the Hackintosh desktop that I'm planning to host at home.
8.  Around $800 more expensive than Ultrabooks I was considering.

One way I think of it is this: I'm really getting 2 fully featured machines. I'll likely use OSX with an Ubuntu guest with 8GB of RAM during my day to day, switching back to the OSX host (with a full 8GB available to itself) whenever I would need to use commercial applications like Photoshop, some games, Apple's Video and Audio editing apps, etc.
