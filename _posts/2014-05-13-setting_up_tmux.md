title: Setting up `tmux`
---

Now that I've *kind of* lost (I hope that I haven't, but I've been lazy to unbury it from my backups, plus I like being kind of forced to re-do my setup from scratch) my old *nix setup, including my .bashrc and my tmux setup, I need to re-do my tmux setup file.

I like tmux to act gnu screen-ish (mainly having Ctrl-A as the start of command sequences, and having both *Ctrl-A Ctrl-A* and *Ctrl-A A* act as _jump to last seen panel_ sequence. I think that's all I need from gnu screen that's initially missing in tmux.
