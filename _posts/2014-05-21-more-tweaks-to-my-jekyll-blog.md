title: More tweaks to my Jekyll blog
---

I've made my Jekyll blog a little better (closer to having proper blog features)
by doing the following:

1.  I fixed the pagination by using the code found at the bottom of the [Jekyll
    guide page on pagination][1].
2.  I added RSS support by adapting one of [the templates I found here][2].

#1 on my **TODO** list is a good commenting model that's compatible with Jekyll's
static site generation.
